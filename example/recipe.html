<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing</strong>. It has been adapted from a number of
    different recipes that I
    have read over the years.</p>

<p><u>Hummus</u> is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with
    salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    <em>1 can (400g) of chick <small>peas</small> (garbanzo beans)</em><br>
    <em>175g of tahini</em><br>
    <em>6 sundried tomatoes</em><br>
    <em>Half a red pepper</em><br>
    <em>A pinch of cayenne pepper</em><br>
    <em>1 clove of garlic</em><br>
    <em>A dash of olive oil</em><br>
</p>

        skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</em><br>
    <em>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</em><br>
    <em>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</em><br>
    <em>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</em><br>
    <em>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</em><br>
    <em>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</em><br>

<mark>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>

<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
